        note : `devleague notes\n How to create an object\n\n - There are three ways to create or initialize an object.\n - You can use new Object(), Object.create(), or use the literal notation.\n - The literal notation is a comma-delimited list of zero or more pairs of property names and associated values enclosed in curly braces.`,
        example : `
var o = {};
var o = {a: 'foo', b: 42, c: {}};

var a = 'foo', b = 42, c = {};
var o = {a: a, b: b, c: c};

var o = {
  property: function ([parameters]) {},
  get property() {},
  set property(value) {}

        note : `November 5, 2017\n What does [object Object] mean?\n\n - Sometimes when console logging or dealing with errors, you will get back a serialization of a certain object type.\n - In other words, it is the return value of that object's toString() function.\n - There are also plenty of other serializations you could see like [object Function], [object Array], [object RegExp], [object Date].`,

//an example of alerting an instance of an object
var objA = {};
var objB = new Object;
var objC = {};

objC.toString = function () { return "objC" };

alert(objA); // [object Object]
